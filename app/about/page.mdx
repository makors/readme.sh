# about me / this blog
heya! i'm [makors](https://github.com/makors), a software engineer and student. i am currently working on a few projects, namely [muko](https://muko.io) (i know, the website isn't up yet) and [dexrs](https://github.com/makors/dexrs) (will be further improved into software for t1d).
<br />
this blog will be used to share my thoughts on web development, my projects, my (development related) frustrations, and other stuff.
<br />
you can contact me via makors at muko.io or through discord (makors) for any questions, concerns, or just to chat.
