## The Start of the Saga
In late 2022, I decided to purchase a [Polono PL60](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0995JWCT1) label printer for my growing e-commerce business. It's a cheap (rebranded) label printer that doesn't support wireless printing.

On a whim, I decided to use a Raspberry Pi to run CUPS with this printer. Easy, right?
<br />

The CUPS installation was pretty uneventful on the Raspberry Pi. I followed a [CUPS Quick Start Guide](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/server/how-to/networking/cups-print-server/index.html) and "successfully" connected the printer.
<br />
I tried printing a test label and... nothing happened. I checked the CUPS logs and...

```
Unable to start filter "raster-tspl" - No such file or directory
```

Oh no.
<br />
## Drivers... or lack thereof
After some frantic googling, I was able to figure out that it was a driver issue. Luckily, the Polono PL60 has drivers for Linux. Problem solved, right? Not even close.
<br />

<p className="text-center text-sm text-gray-400 pb-2">Why are the Linux drivers so out of date?</p>

I attempted to install the above drivers above (using the included script) but it didn't work because I was using an ARM device (the Raspberry Pi), but the drivers were only intended for x86_64 devices (Intel/AMD).
<br />

Google searches and AI just kept sending me down entirely unhelpful rabbit holes. No matter what I did, I couldn't even seem to find *any* driver for my printer or even some sort of solution.
<br />
That was until I found [this post](https://kubesail.com/blog/2022-02-01-printer-driver-in-javascript) and this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kubesail/raster-to-tspl-js) describing my exact issue and providing a JS driver.

After making some code changes (it was some old code), I was able to get the printer working. There was one glaring issue, though: it won't work with CUPS
